## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

![Agile Software Development](/images/scrum/SCRUM-1.jpg)

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

[Through this work we have come to value](https://agilemanifesto.org/){.extarnal}

- Individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools
- Working software **over** comprehensive documentatio
- Customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation
- Responding to change **over** following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Backlog

**Sprint Velocity** - Number of Story Points completed per Sprint

![All actors in SCRUM](/images/scrum/SCRUM-2.jpg)

**Product Backlog** – is an always changing, dynamically prioritized list of requirements ordered by Business Value. Requirements are broken down into User Stories by the Product Owner. Definition of Done (DoD) at the Backlog level.

**Sprint Backlog** - contains all committed User Stories for the current Sprint broken down into Tasks by the Team. All items on the Sprint Backlog should be developed, tested, documented and integrated to fulfill the Team commitment.

![Burndown Chart](/images/scrum/SCRUM-3.jpg)

**Burndown Chart** - shows the amount of work remaining per Sprint. It shows the correlation between work remaining at any point in time and the progress of the Team.


## Core concpets: invest - user story - done - poker

The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story. If the story fails to meet one of these criteria, the team may want to reword it, or even consider a rewrite (which often translates into physically tearing up the old story card and writing a new one).

A good user story should be:

- “I” ndependent (of all others)
- “N” egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
- “V” aluable (or vertical)
- “E” stimable (to a good approximation)
- “S” mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
- “T” estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)

For a user story, the next template should be used: 

As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.


**Epic** – a user story that covers large amounts of functionality. Because an epic is generally too large for an Agile team to complete in one iteration, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before it is worked on

**User Story** - is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

**Acceptance Criteria** - list of activities that must be fulfilled in order to consider US done

**INVEST** - helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story.

![Plannig poker](/images/scrum/poker.png)

**Planning poker** -  also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud.
