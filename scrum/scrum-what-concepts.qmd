# SCRUM

:::{.summary}
📘 **SCRUM definition**

Scrum is a framework for project management that is based on teamwork, accountability, transparency and short time-boxed **iterative** progress toward a **well-defined goal**.

The framework begins with a simple premise: **start with what can be seen or known**. After that, track the progress and **adapt**, whenever it is necessary.

At the end of each iteration, the team holds two meetings: **one review** to show the work done for clients and to get feedback, and **one retrospective** to enable the team to reflect and improve.

## Introduction

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products.

Scrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written The Scrum Guide to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly.

This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.

Scrum is: Lightweight, Simple to understand and Difficult to master

At the very beginning, when they were just a startup, they used all Lean Startup tips to achieve the success. They did unscalable things, bought some spares for rockets in usual computer shops, made some spares by themselves, etc. 

All of these were a total craziness for classical aerospace companies. But it was the key benefit how they competed mastodons, like Lockheed and Boeing. 

Testing of hypotheses, tight budgets, and continuous innovations made the appreciable contribution to company success.

Perhaps, it’s not a classical Scrum approach like software companies use, but it’s from the field of Kaizen and The Toyota Way. This is how startups should behave.


## SCRUM members


### The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team is made up of the people who actually work on Product Backlog Items during a Sprint. In a software context, this group is most often called the Development Team. In other contexts, the simple term Team is often used. The Scrum Master and the Product Owner, while part of the overall Scrum Team, may or may not be members of the Team working on PBIs. There is no Project Manager or Team Lead in Scrum. Everyone is simply an equal member of the Team. 

The Scrum team is:

1. Transcendent 
2. Autonomous 
3. Cross-Functional

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is tasked with making Scrum work. They work intimately with the Team, sometimes as a member. Their primary task is to remove Impediments and guide the team in Scrum practices. The Scrum Master does whatever it takes to help the team succeed.

Scrum Masters are servant-leaders, not managers. They play the pivotal role of making sure Scrum is practiced well. The Scrum Master is accountable for the Velocity and the Continuous Improvement of the Team.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is the Team member who knows what the customer wants and the relative business value of those wants. He or she can then translate the customer's wants and values back to the Scrum team.

The Product Owner must know the business case for the product and what features the customers wants. He must be available to consult with the team to make sure they are correctly implementing the product vision. Most importantly, he must have the authority to make all decisions necessary to complete the project.

## Agile Manifesto Four Fundations

Through this work we have come to value:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
