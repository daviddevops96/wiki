In Spring Boot, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is used to separate the application logic into three components: Model - View -Controller

📘 **Model**

The model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the state of the application and communicating with other components, such as the database or external services.
