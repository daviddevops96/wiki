## Overview

The [Spring Web](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html) model-view-controller (MVC) framework is designed around a DispatcherServlet that dispatches requests to handlers, with configurable handler mappings, view resolution, locale and theme resolution as well as support for uploading files.

The default handler is based on the @Controller and @RequestMapping annotations, offering a wide range of flexible handling methods.

With the introduction of Spring 3.0, the @Controller mechanism also allows you to create RESTful Web sites and applications, through the @PathVariable annotation and other features.
