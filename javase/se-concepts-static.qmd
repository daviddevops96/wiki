## Overview

::: {.summary}

📘 **static modifier**

In Java, the `static` modifier is used to indicate that a **class or class member belongs to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class**.

In other words, the `static` modifier indicates that the class or class member is associated with the class as a whole, rather than with a specific instance of the class.

Classical use and basic exmaple of ``static method``, we **call within the ``class`` our ``static`` ``method``** just using the name of the method ``printArea()``: 

![Two static methods with parameters. Parameters are the variables we use in the method definition whereas arguments are the values we pass in the method call. These two terms are often used interchangeably](/images/javase/staticMethod.png)

The `static` modifier has several different uses in Java, depending on where it is applied. Here are some examples of how the `static` modifier can be used in Java.

## ``static`` code block

In Java, we have a special block known as a` Static Initialization Block`. A `Static Initialization Block` is **executed before the `main()` method**, it will execute once. This block will not return anything and we can not use the `this` keyword since it does **not have any instance**.

For example:

``` {.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="MovieManager.java"}
static {            
    int count = 0;
    String name ="Alien";
    double priceMovie = 45.50;
};
```


## ``static`` field

**When applied to a field**, the `static` modifier indicates that the field belongs to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class. This means that all instances of the class share the same value for the `static` field.

For example:

``` {.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="Counter.java"}
public class Counter {
    // Static field
    private static int count = 0;

    // Constructor
    public Counter() {
        count++;
    }

    // Getter method for the count field
    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

```
::: {.column-margin}
In this example, the `count` field is marked as `static`, which means that all instances of the `Counter` class share the same value for the `count` field. When a new instance of the `Counter` class is created, the `count` field is incremented, and the new value is shared by all instances of the class.
:::

Another example:

``` {.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="Account.java"}
public class Account {
    // Static field
    private static int nextAccountNumber = 1;

    // Private instance variables
    private int accountNumber;
    private String name;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor
    public Account(String name, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = nextAccountNumber++;
        this.name = name;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    // Getter method for the accountNumber field
    public int getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    // Getter method for the name field
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Getter method for the balance field
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Method for depositing money into the account
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    // Method for withdrawing money from the account
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```
::: {.column-margin}
In this example, the `Account` class defines a `nextAccountNumber` field that is marked as `static`. This means that the `nextAccountNumber` field belongs to the `Account` class itself, rather than to an instance of the `Account` class. This means that all instances of the `Account` class share the same value for the `nextAccountNumber` field.
:::

When a new instance of the `Account` class is created, the `nextAccountNumber` field is incremented, and the new value is shared by all instances of the class. This allows each instance of the `Account` class to have a unique `accountNumber` field, which is generated automatically using the `nextAccountNumber` field.

## ``static`` method

**When applied to a method**, the `static` modifier indicates that the method belongs to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class. This means that the `static` method can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class.

For example:

``` {.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="MathUtils.java"}
public class MathUtils {
    // Static method
    public static double squareRoot(double number) {
        return Math.sqrt(number);
    }
}
```
::: {.column-margin}
In this example, the `squareRoot()` method is marked as `static`, which means that it can be called on the `MathUtils` class itself, rather than on an instance of the `MathUtils` class. This allows the `squareRoot()` method to be called without creating an instance of the `MathUtils` class, which can be useful in some situations.
:::

For example:

``` {.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="MovieManager.java"}
public class MovieManager {

    // Static method
    public static boolean createMovie(Movie movie) {
        boolean result = false;
        // to-do algorithmic to solve this method
        return result;
    }

    // Static method
    public static boolean deleteMovie(String idMovie) {
        boolean result = false;
        // to-do algorithmic to solve this method
        return result;
    }

    // Static method
    public static boolean updateMovie(Movie movie) {
        boolean result = false;
        // to-do algorithmic to solve this method
        return result;
    }

    // Static method
    public static List<Movie> getAllMovies() {
        List<Movie> movies = new ArrayList<>();
        // to-do algorithmic to solve this method
        return movies;
    }

    // Static method
    public static List<Movie> findMovie(String title) {
        List<Movie> movies = new ArrayList<>();
        // to-do algorithmic to solve this method
        return movies;
    }
    
}
```
<div class="mermaidContent">

``` {mermaid}
classDiagram
  class Movie {
    -title: String
    -reviews: List<Review>
    -director: Director
  }
  
  class Critic {
    -publications: int
  }
  
  class Director {
    -oscars: int
  }
  class Review {
    -rating: int
    -comment: String
    -critic: Critic
  }
  class Person {
    -name: String
  }
  
  class MovieManager {
    -static boolean deleteMovie(id)$
    -static boolean createMovie(id)$
    -static boolean updateMovie(id)$
    -getAllMovies()$ List~Movie~
    -findMovie(id)$ List~Movie
  }

  MovieManager -- Movie
  Movie *-- Review
  Movie *-- Director
  Review o-- Critic
  Person <-- Director
  Person <-- Critic

```
</div>




## ``static`` class


**When applied to a class**, the `static` modifier indicates that the class is a **nested class**. In other words, the `static` class is defined inside another class, and is associated with the outer class.

``` {.java .code-overflow-wrap filename="Account.java"}
public class Account {
    // Static field
    private static int nextAccountNumber = 1;

    // Private instance variables
    private int accountNumber;
    private String name;
    private double balance;

    // Static nested class
    public static class Transaction {
        // Private instance variables
        private int transactionNumber;
        private double amount;
        private String type;

        // Constructor
        public Transaction(double amount, String type) {
            this.transactionNumber = nextAccountNumber++;
            this.amount = amount;
            this.type = type;
        }

        // Getter method for the transactionNumber field
        public int getTransactionNumber() {
            return transactionNumber;
        }

        // Getter method for the amount field
        public double getAmount() {
            return amount;
        }

        // Getter method for the type field
        public String getType() {
            return type;
        }
    }

    // Constructor
    public Account(String name, double balance) {
        this.accountNumber = nextAccountNumber++;
        this.name = name;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    // Getter method for the accountNumber field
    public int getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    // Getter method for the name field
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Getter method for the balance field
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

}

```

Here is an example of how the ``static`` modifier can be used when applied to a ``class`` in ``Java``, using an ``Account`` class and a nested ``Transaction`` class as examples:
:::

##  `static` vs. `non-static`

### Pros & cons usage `static` methods

| Pros of making a method static  | Cons of making a method static |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Can be called directly on the class, without needing to create an instance | Cannot access non-static fields and methods of the class |
| Can be used as utility methods that don't depend on the state of an object | Can only work with the parameters passed to it and not use information unique to each object or instance |
| Can be used to access only static variables and methods, making it more efficient | Can be challenging to make sure all instances of a class are modified consistently when using static methods |

### Pros & cons usage `non-static` methods

| Pros of making a method non-static  | Cons of making a method non-static |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Can access both static and non-static fields and methods of the class, allowing it to use the state of an object to determine its behavior | Can only be called on an instance of the class, so you need to create an object of a class before using the method |
| Are associated with an instance of the class, so they can use the information that is unique to each object | Can cause confusion when working with non-static methods because it could be called on different instances, which could cause unexpected behavior |
| Object-oriented design principles promote the use of non-static methods because they can be overridden by subclasses to change their behavior |  |
