## Overview

::: {.summary}

📘 **Virtual DOM**

The virtual DOM ``VDOM`` is a <mark>programming concept where an ideal, or ``virtual``, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the ``real`` DOM<mark> by a library such as **ReactDOM**.

This process is called [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html){.external}.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, ``React`` creates a ``virtual DOM`` [in memory](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html){.external}, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the real ``browser DOM``.

This approach enables the **declarative API of React**: you tell ``React`` **what state you want the UI to be in**, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state

This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app.

## How Virtual-DOM and diffing works in React

![The virtual DOM ``VDOM`` is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM: [How Virtual-DOM and diffing works in React ](https://medium.com/@gethylgeorge/how-virtual-dom-and-diffing-works-in-react-6fc805f9f84e)](/images/reactjs/virtual-dom.png){width=70%}

:::{.column-margin}
When the state of a React component changes, the component re-renders and creates a new ``VDOM`` tree. React then compares this new tree to the previous ``VDOM`` tree, using a process called "diffing."
:::

In React, the virtual DOM ``VDOM`` is a <mark>lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM</mark>. It is a tree-like structure with a hierarchy of node objects that corresponds to the structure of the DOM. Each node in the ``VDOM`` tree represents an element in the actual DOM, and has properties that correspond to the attributes and content of that element.

::: {.callout-note}
During the ``diffing process``, React compares the two ``VDOM`` trees, **node by node**, and determines which nodes have changed, added, or removed. React then updates the actual ``DOM`` with the minimum number of changes necessary to reflect the changes in the ``VDOM``.
:::

This process helps to improve the performance of React applications, because it reduces the number of ``DOM`` manipulations that are required to keep the ``DOM`` up-to-date with the component's state.

The diffing algorithm used by React is based on a concept called ``reconciliation``. During ``reconciliation``, React compares the ``VDOM`` nodes and their children, and determines the minimum number of steps that are needed to transform the old tree into the new tree.

This process helps to minimize the number of ``DOM`` manipulations that are required, and makes React updates faster and more efficient.
